		<h1>I like telling stories</h1>

		<p>I wanted to create one space where I could compile together all of my creations. I love to write, take photos, and play music, but really whatever I can get my hands on. Welcome to my world.</p>

		<p>I like you. In fact, I really like you. At least I would if we met. I know this because I truly believe the both of us are very good for people. If you had met me four years ago, though, things would be totally different. I didn't believe this to be true about myself, and because I didn't believe it, I didn't really like myself.</p>
		<p>The problem is that I didn't understand who I was created to be, and I definitely didn't understand what I was created to do.</p>
