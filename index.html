			<h2 align="center">Zoe, it's almost time for our first <span id="dark">date!</span></h2>
			<p align="center">This time I thought I'd keep it simple, but it's still a secret! That's why there are no photos.. yet. You know me a bit by now so I'm sure it doesn't come as a surprise that I want to be able to remember days like this. I thought it would be fun to have a place where we could come back and remember all of the fun things we have done. I've never done anything like this, but I think it'll be fun!</p>
			<p align="center">But first things first, there are a few things you need to know before we go!</p>
		</div>
		<div id="four">
			<p>- Come wearing a change of clothes you don't mind getting dirty in.</p>
			<br />
			<p>- Bring a second change of clothes you can be comfortable in and a jacket just in case.</p>
			<br />
			<p>- Be ready for a lot of fun!</p>
		</div>
		<div id="five" align="center">
			<p>Hopefully you are as excited as I am! Can't wait to spend the afternoon with you.</p>
